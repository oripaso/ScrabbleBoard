# ScrabbleBoard

In this project I built the game Book Scrabble - similar to the game Scrabble the players will have to put together words that intersect with
each other like in a crossword puzzle and score points. 
However, the legal words are not all the words in the dictionary
English, but only words that appear in the books chosen for the game.
In this section, a generic server will be built in stages that will allow the user to play against the server.
